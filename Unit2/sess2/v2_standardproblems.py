#UPI: Understand, Plan, and Implement.

#Problem 1: You're planning an epic trip and have a dictionary of 
# destinations mapped to their respective rating scores. Your goal is to 
# visit only the best-rated destinations. Write a function that takes in a 
# dictionary destinations and a rating_threshold as parameters. The function 
# should iterate through the dictionary and remove all destinations that have
# a rating strictly below the rating_threshold. Return the updated dictionary.

#Problem 2: As a seasoned traveler, you've collected a variety of souvenirs 
# from different destinations. You have an array of string souvenirs, where 
# each string represents a type of souvenir. You want to know if the number 
# of occurrences of each type of souvenir in your collection is unique.

# number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or False 
# otherwise.

#Problem 3: You make friends with a local at your latest destination, and 
# they give you a coded message with the name of a secret beach most tourists 
# don't know about! You are given the strings key and message which represent
# a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode the 
# message are as follows:

#Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the 
# order of the substitution table.
#Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
#Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
#Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
#For example, given key = "travel the world" (an actual key would have at 
# least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial 
# substitution table of ('t' -> 'a', 'r' -> 'b', 'a' -> 'c', 'v' -> 'd', 'e' 
# -> 'e', 'l' -> 'f', 'h' -> 'g', 'w' -> 'h', 'o' -> 'i', 'd' -> 'j').

#Write a function decode_message() that accepts the strings key and message 
# and returns a string representing the decoded message.

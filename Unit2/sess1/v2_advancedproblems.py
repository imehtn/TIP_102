#UPI: Understand, Plan, and Implement.

#------------------------------------
#Problem 1: In the ancient Library of Alexandria, a temporal rift has 
# scattered several important scrolls across different rooms. You are given a
# dictionary library_catalog that maps room names to the number of scrolls 
# that room should have and a second dictionary actual_distribution that maps
# room names to the number of scrolls found in that room after the temporal 
# rift.

#Write a function analyze_library() that determines if any room has more or
# fewer scrolls than it should. The function should return a dictionary 
# where the keys are the room names and the values are the differences in
# the number of scrolls (actual number of scrolls - expected number of 
# scrolls). You must loop over the dictionaries to compute the differences.

print("Problem 1")

    for room, number in actual_distribution.items():
        #if room is not added to the dictionary
        if room not in res:
            #add the room as key and the diff b/w actual aand expected as value
            res[room] = number - library_catalog[room]
    
    return res 
    
library_catalog = {

#Problem 2: You've spent your last few trips exploring different periods of 
# Ancient Greece. During your travels, you discover several interesting 
# artifacts. Some artifacts appear in multiple time periods, while others in
# just one.

#You are given two lists of strings artifacts1 and artifacts2 representing
# the artifacts found in two different time periods. Write a function

# time periods.

#Problem 3: As a time traveler, you've collected a mountain of souvenirs over 
# the course of your travels. You're running out of room to store them all 
# and need to declutter. Given a list of strings souvenirs and a integer 
# threshold, declutter your souvenirs by writing a function declutter() that
# returns a list of souvenirs strictly below threshold.

#Problem 5: As a time traveler, you have recorded the occurrences of specific
# events at different time points. You suspect that some events might be
# occurring too frequently within short time spans, indicating potential 
# temporal anomalies. Given an array time_points where each element 
# represents an event ID at a particular time point, and an integer k, 
# determine if there are two distinct time points i and j such that 
# time_points[i] == time_points[j] and the absolute difference between i and

#Problem 6: A group of time travelers are competing in a series of races to

# the year 4050.

#You're given a list of race outcomes in the form of an integer array races,

# winner defeated the traveler loser in a race.

#Write a function find_travelers() that accepts the integer array races as a
# parameter and returns a list answer of length 2 where:

#answer[0] is a list of all travelers who have not lost any races.

#Both the input list races and your output list answer should be sorted in 
# increasing order.

#Note: Only include travelers who have competed in at least one race â€” that
# is, those who appear as either a winner or a loser in the input list races.
# For example, if races = [[1,2], [5, 6], that may imply the existence of 
# racers 3 and 4. However, since neither racer 3 nor 4 is included in the 
# input list, 3 and 4 should also not appear in the output list answer.
